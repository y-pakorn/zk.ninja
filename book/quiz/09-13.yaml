  question: Which of these following tuples are a group?
  distractors:
    - text: $(\mathbb{R}, *)$
      reason: 0 doesn't have a multiplicative inverse
    - text: $(\mathbb{N}, +)$
      reason: No identity element nor inverse
    - text: $(\mathbb{Z}, *)$
      reason: Not all integers have a multiplicative inverse

  answers: $(\mathbb{R - {0}}, *)$

  question: Which of these sets have closure property under "multiplicative operation"
  distractors:
    - text: $\mathbb{I}$ aka a set of irrational numbers
      reason: $\sqrt{2} * \sqrt{2} = 2$
    - A set of prime numbers
    - A set of negative integers
  answers:
    - A set of odd numbers
    - A set of positive integers
    - $\mathbb{N}$ aka a set of natural numbers

  question: Given $\mathbb{T} = (\mathbb{Z},-)$, does $\mathbb{T}$ have associative property?
  distractors:
    - text: No
      reason: Since (5-3)-2 = 0 but 5-(3-2) = 4
  answers: Yes
