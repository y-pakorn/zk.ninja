  question: Which of these sets have closure property under "multiplicative operation"
  distractors:
    - text: $\mathbb{I}$ aka a set of irrational numbers
      reason: $\sqrt{2} * \sqrt{2} = 2$
    - A set of prime numbers
    - A set of negative integers
  answers:
    - A set of odd numbers
    - A set of positive integers
    - $\mathbb{N}$ aka a set of natural numbers
