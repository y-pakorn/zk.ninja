  question: Explain why RSA Encryption/Decryption make sense i.e. decryption of the cipher text return the same number back.

    Yes, because $c^d \equiv (m^e)^d \equiv m^{ed}\ mod\ n$. Then given that $de \equiv 1\ mod\ \phi(n)$, it must exist an integer k such that $de = k\phi(n)+1$. 
    Now, we subsitute de, and we get $c^d \equiv m^{k\phi(n)+1} \equiv m*(m^{\phi(n)})^k$. 
    From Euler's Theorem, therefore, $(m^{\phi(n)})^k \equiv 1\ mod\ n$  Thefore, $c^d \equiv m\ mod\ n$, returning the original plaintext
