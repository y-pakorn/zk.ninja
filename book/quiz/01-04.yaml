  question: Explain by giving an example how applying modulo to operations can transform an infinite set of a group into a finite one.
  clarification: By applying modulo to operation, we mean that we perform operation, then modulo it. For example, addition under modulo is (a+b) mod n
  context: >
    Modular Addition gives out finite set
    Consider the set $\{0,1,2,3,4\}$ with the operation of "Addition modulo 5." This set, unlike an infinite set of integers, is finite because any addition will result in a number thatâ€™s wrapped around within the set. For example, 3 + 4 = 7, then 7 mod 5 - 2, so 3+4 in this context is equivalent to 2 which already exists in the set

  question: Explain by giving an example why having modulo makes it harder to find the original number. (Can consider the example of factorizing the result with vs without modulo)
