#  Why is RSA Encryption/Decryption secure?

Let’s analyze security from different perspectives:

## What Does an Outsider See?
An outsider observing an RSA-encrypted message has access to:

The public key: 
(e,N), where e is the encryption exponent and 
N=p⋅q is the modulus.
The ciphertext: C=M 
e
 modN, where 
𝑀 is the original plaintext message.

To decrypt the message and retrieve M, the outsider would need the private key, which requires knowledge of d, the decryption exponent. However:

Why can't the outsider calculate d?
To find d, the outsider must compute the modular inverse of 
emodϕ(N), where ϕ(N)=(p−1)(q−1). This requires knowledge of ϕ(N), which depends on the factors p and q of N.

Why can't the outsider factorize N?
The RSA security assumption relies on the difficulty of the Integer Factorization Problem:

Given N=p⋅q, it is computationally infeasible to determine the prime factors p and q if N is sufficiently large (e.g., 2048 bits).
Without p and q, the outsider cannot compute ϕ(N) or the private key d.
Thus, the outsider is stuck with C, e, and 𝑁 but cannot derive M.

## Can Alice Learn Bob’s Private Value?

Suppose Alice is an authorized sender and knows:

Bob’s public key: (e,N).
Her own plaintext message: M.
The ciphertext she sent: 
C=M 
e
 modN.
Even with this information:

Alice cannot derive Bob’s private key d, as she would need to factorize N to compute ϕ(N).
The security of RSA ensures that knowing M and C does not help in determining d.

Core Assumptions Behind RSA Security
RSA’s security is built on two foundational computational problems:

Integer Factorization Problem (IFP):

Given N=p⋅q, it is computationally infeasible to determine the prime factors p and q for large values of N (e.g., 2048 bits).
RSA Problem:

Given C=M 
e
 modN, 
𝑒
e, and 
𝑁
, it is computationally infeasible to recover M without knowing the private key d
Both problems remain computationally hard as long as N is large and properly generated (with sufficiently random, large primes p and q).

Why RSA is Hard to Break
Brute Force Attack:
Factorizing a large N (2048+ bits) is infeasible with current algorithms and computing power.

Mathematical Attacks:
Attacks like the Pollard’s rho algorithm, elliptic curve factorization, or the quadratic sieve are effective for small 
𝑁
N but are impractical for well-chosen large 
𝑁
N.

Quantum Computing:
Shor’s algorithm can theoretically break RSA by efficiently factorizing 
𝑁
N. However, practical quantum computers capable of breaking RSA-sized keys do not yet exist, making RSA secure for now.



RSA Limitations and Challenges
Performance:
RSA encryption and decryption are computationally intensive, especially with large keys.

Quantum Threat:
Shor’s algorithm, if implemented on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer, could break RSA by efficiently factoring 
𝑛
n.
