# Some Necessary Math Backgrounds

Before getting to RSA, let's make sure to visit some quic Math concepts that are necessary to understand the protocol.

## Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

GCD is the largest positive integer that divides two or more integers without leaving a remainder.

### Example

GCD(4, 8) = 4 because 4 is the largest number that divides both 4 and 8

GCD(34, 51) = 17 because 17 is the largest number that divides both 34 and 51

## Co-Prime

We called two integers $a, b$ co-prime to each other when GCD(a,b) = 1

## Euler’s Totient Function

TODO: should we explore this in detail instead of just giving formula?

Euler Totient Function $\phi(n)$ is the function that counts the integers less than $n$ that are coprime to $n$. 

Given $n = \prod_{i=1}^{r}p_i^{k_i}$, 

$\phi(n) =\phi(p_1^{k_1}) \phi(p_2^{k_2})... \phi(p_r^{k_r})$

$= p_1^{k_1}(1-\frac{1}{p_1})p_2^{k_2}(1-\frac{1}{p_2})... p_r^{k_r}(1-\frac{1}{p_r})$

$= p_1^{k_1}p_2^{k_2}...p_r^{k_r}(1-\frac{1}{p_1})(1-\frac{1}{p_2})...(1-\frac{1}{p_r})$

$= n(1-\frac{1}{p_1})(1-\frac{1}{p_2})...(1-\frac{1}{p_r})$

## Euler’s Theorem

For any co-prime $a, n$. This statement is true: $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1\ mod\ n$

## Integer Factorization Problem (IFP)

The Integer Factorization Problem asserts that:

Given: A large integer $n=p*q$ (e.g. 2048 bits)., where $p,q$ are large prime number.

Assumption: It is computationally infeasible to factor $n$ into $p*q$ in polynomial time with classical computers.
