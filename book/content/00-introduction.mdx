# Framework for ZKP Education

This document details framework in revolutionizing cryptography/ zkp education to make it more interactive and intuitive for beginners wanting to get into these fields where most perceive as "moon math". Most importantly, make them able to think like cryptographer! and hopefully can use the process of creating the material as a way to engage community and do study group tgt on each topic :)

Audience: Beginner with some technical background, yet too scared to read textbooks & fall asleep watching online lecture video. Those who dont have intuitive sense of how to learn this kind of cryptography stuffs.

Here, we outline framework & example for our POC for 2 things:

- Definition: When new concept gets introduced in cryptography, we want to make sure students really understand what that concept really means.
- Scheme: When cryptographic scheme gets introduced, we want to make sure students really understand why the scheme makes sense & why it is secure.

## Definition

- Make sure students understand what that definition really means through many types of quizes as follows
  - (forward) Is 'this example' a "definition"?
  - (backward) Give your example of a "definition"? (or let them select from multiple choices)
  - (reasoning) Why is this behavior possible? (expect students to answer one or a few of its properties/ definition that make the behavior in the question makes sense)
    - Make students get into habit of breaking things down until reaching the root cause that makes the behavior true.
- Onboard students to new symbol/notation seamlessly --> not introduce them all at once, slowly inject them throughout the quiz/ example

## Scheme

- Make sure students understand why the scheme makes sense through variable substitution
- Make sure students understand why the scheme is secure through breaking down things down to the assumption.
  - Scenario simulation
