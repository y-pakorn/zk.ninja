# Introduction

# Framework for ZKP Education

This document details a framework aiming to revolutionize cryptography & zero-knowledge-proof education, powering it to be intuitive & interactive for beginners who want to get into these fields where most perceive as "moon math". 

Most importantly, we want to empower people to think like cryptographer! We also hope this project can serve as template to inspire & engage community in forming study groups and contributing to public goods by creating their own curricula :)


Audience: Beginner with some technical background, yet too scared to read textbooks & fall asleep watching online lecture video. Those who dont have intuitive sense of how to actually learn this kind of cryptography stuffs, including those that finish all lectures only to forget everything and can't really utilize the knowledge.

Here, we outline framework & example for our POC for 2 things:

- Definition: When new concept gets introduced in cryptography, we want to make sure students really understand what that concept really means.
- Scheme: When cryptographic scheme gets introduced, we want to make sure students really understand why the scheme makes sense & why it is secure.

## Definition

- Make sure students understand what that definition really means through many types of quizes as follows
  - (ChoiceQuiz) 
    - Single Choice: Is 'this example' a "definition"?
    - Multiple Choice: Select these that are "definition"
  - (OpenEndedQuiz) 
    - Explain what is "a definition" in your own word.
    - Give your example of a "definition".
    - Why is this behavior possible? (expect students to answer one or a few of its properties/ definition that make the behavior in the question makes sense)
    Make students get into habit of breaking things down until reaching the root cause that makes the behavior true.
- Onboard students to new symbol/notation seamlessly --> not introduce them all at once, slowly inject them throughout the quiz/ example

## Scheme

- Make sure students understand why the scheme makes sense through variable substitution
- Make sure students understand why the scheme is secure through breaking down things down to the assumption.
  - Scenario simulation
  - Engage them to explain in their own word what makes the scheme secure
