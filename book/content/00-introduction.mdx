# Introduction

# Framework for ZKP Education

This document details a framework aiming to revolutionize cryptography & zero-knowledge-proof education, powering it to be intuitive & interactive for beginners who want to get into these fields where most perceive as "moon math". 

Most importantly, we want to empower people to think like cryptographer! We also hope this project can serve as template to inspire & engage community in forming study groups and contributing to public goods by creating their own curricula :)


Audience: Beginner with some technical background, yet too scared to read textbooks & fall asleep watching online lecture video. Those who dont have intuitive sense of how to actually learn this kind of math/cryptography stuffs, including those that finish all lectures only to forget everything and can't really utilize the knowledge.
