# Asymmetric Encryption!
In the world of cryptography, the development of asymmetric cryptography marked a revolution in secure communications. Unlike symmetric cryptography, which requires both parties to share a secret key, asymmetric cryptography leverages a pair of keys — one public and one private — to ensure confidentiality, authentication, and integrity. This chapter will build on our foundational knowledge of sets, groups, modulo operations, cyclic groups, generators, and hardness assumptions to explore the mechanics and significance of RSA, one of the most prominent asymmetric encryption schemes.

At its core, asymmetric cryptography uses a key pair:

A public key, which is shared openly and used for encryption.
A private key, kept secret and used for decryption.

And asymmetric cryptography is mainly used for 2 things: encryption/decryption & digital signatures.
-Encryption/Decrytion: Basically anyone can use public key to encrypt the data, but only the one with private key that can decrypt the data.
-Digital Signature: A person could use his private key to create digital signature, and anyone can use public key to verify that this is actually digitally signed by that person with the private key corresponding to the public key.

Unlike Symmetric Cryptography in previous chapter that the real-world protocol is very complicated, here we will dive deep into asymmetric cryptography protocol that really gets used in real world: RSA
