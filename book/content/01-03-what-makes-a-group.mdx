# Bringing It All Together: What Makes a Group?

To sum up, A set $\mathbb{S}$ with an operation $o$ $(\mathbb{S}, o)$ is a Group If and Only if it satisfies these four properties

- Closure: Combining any two elements produces another element in the set.
- Associativity: The way you group elements doesn't change the result.
- Identity Element: There's an element that doesn't change other elements when combined.
- Inverse Element: Every element has a counterpart that combines with it to produce the identity element.

$\textbf{Quiz}$ Which of these following tuples are a group?

a. $(\mathbb{R - {0}}, *)$ yes
b. $(\mathbb{R}, *)$ no, since 0 doesn't have a multiplicative inverse
c. $(\mathbb{N}, +)$ no, since no identity element nor inverse
d. $(\mathbb{Z}, *)$ no, not all integers have a multiplicative inverse

$\textbf{Quiz}$ Write a tuple of (set, operation) of your own that is a group?
(Suggestion: can we let students fill anything as answer --> hard to check, but can be interactive to guide students step-by-step to check each property --> like let's carefully check each property and let student fill in things and algo verifies it. For example, inverse property, find edge case in their set, and point that out, guiding students to try to find its inverse only to find out that it's not existed in their set.)

$\textbf{Quiz}$ (reasoning) With what we've learnt above, let's try to solve equation with our new lenses of properties, understanding why we are able to make each transition step in finding the solution!

Consider a group of $(\mathbb{G}, *)$

> Solve equation of $a*x = a*b$

Solution step by step, (but will not be just shown everything)

1. Due to Inverse property, there exists inverse of $a$, which is $a^{-1}$

> $a^{-1}*(a*x) = a^{-1}*(a*b)$

2. Use associativity property

> $(a^{-1}*a)*x = (a^{-1}*a)*b$

3. Use Inverse property

> $e*x = e*b$

4. Use Identity property

> $x = b$

The way to execute this quiz is as follows:

To make sure students learn to break things down line by line by having lines for student to fill up each step of computation. maybe we have sth filled up 1 line, then let students fill the other 2 lines only to reach another line that we already filled for them, and so on... (Not a good idea to just like show 10 blank lines and let students figure it out ALL themselves)

Then for each transition of the line, we asks multiple-choice questions to students:

$\textbf{Quiz}$ Which group property justifies the transition from $𝑏∗(𝑎∗𝑥)$ to $(b∗a)∗x?$
a) Associativity
b) Inverse Element Property
c) Identity Element Property
d) Closure Property
