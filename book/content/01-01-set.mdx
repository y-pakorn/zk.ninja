# Set: A group of numbers!

## Definition

A set is simply a collection of things (in our case, numbers).

## Why Matters?

Why Concept of Set Matters in Cryptography

Since there are so many types of numbers (integers, decimals, rationals, etc. ), we need a way to categorize and organize them based on shared properties, helping us to better understand and use them in Math. That is where "Set" comes in.

## Notations

The symbol $\in$ means "is a member of a set." So, if something is on the left side of $\in$, it belongs to the collection (set) on the right side.

### Example on Notation

(We clarify what the example is about)
Given the set $\mathbb{S} = \{1, 4, 7, 8, 9\}$:
We can write
4 $\in \mathbb{S}$ (4 is in the set $\mathbb{S}$)
5 $\notin \mathbb{S}$ (5 is not in the set $\mathbb{S}$)

Besides defining the set by listing all its members like $\mathbb{S} = \{1, 4, 7, 8, 9\}$ explicitly, we can define sets more broadly, using rules or patterns that describe their shared properties.

### Example of defining the set

(Here again, clarify what the example is for)
$\mathbb{Z} = \{..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3,...\}$ represents the set of all integers (whole numbers).
$\mathbb{Z^+} = \{1, 2, 3,...\}$ represents the set of positive integers. (Another common notation for positive integers or natural numbers is $\mathbb{N}$.)
$\mathbb{Q} = \{x : x = a/b;\ a, b \in \mathbb{Z},\ b \neq 0\}$ represents the set of rational numbers, which includes any number that can be written as a fraction of two integers.

Sets lets us define and organize collections of numbers based on shared characteristics. But in cryptography, we are not only interested in what collection of numbers we are using, but also how these numbers interact with each other. This is where operation comes in. When we combine a set with an operation, under specific rules, we arrive at a special mathematical structure called a 'Group.' Groups are the building blocks of many cryptographic algorithms, offering powerful properties weâ€™ll soon explore."
