# Modulo with Operation

We usually use Modulo with Operation. For example, Modular Addition, which is defined as $\forall\ a,b \in \mathbb{Z_n}$, modular addition results is calculated as (a+b) mod n

## Example

Modular Addition gives out finite set

Consider the set $\{0,1,2,3,4\}$ with the operation of "Addition modulo 5." This set, unlike an infinite set of integers, is finite because any addition will result in a number that’s wrapped around within the set. For example, 3 + 4 = 7, then 7 mod 5 - 2, so 3+4 in this context is equivalent to 2 which already exists in the set

Now we know that with modulo, we can have a group with finite set that is what cryptography operation needs. We introduce a concept of Cyclic Group & generator

## Definition

Cyclic Group & Generator

A group is **cyclic** if there exists an element (**"a generator"**) such that every other element of the group can be written as a power of this generator.

## Math Expression

Consider the Group $\mathbb{G} =  \{1,2,3,...,p−1\}$ with "Modular Multiplication" Operation. $\mathbb{G}$ is cyclic if and only if there exists the element $𝑔$ (called a generator), such that $\{g^1 \ mod\ p\ , g^2 \ mod\ p\ , g^3 \ mod\ p\ , ...,\ g^{p-1}\ mod\ p\}$ = $\mathbb{S}$

## Example

Let’s say we work in $\mathbb{Z^*_7}$ (integers modulo 7, excluding 0), which consists of {1,2,3,4,5,6}. We can check if 3 is a generator as follows:
$3^1\ mod\ 7 = 3,\ 3^2\ mod\ 7 = 2,\ 3^3\ mod\ 7 = 6,\  3^4\ mod\ 7 = 4,\ 3^5\ mod\ 7 = 5,\ 3^6\ mod\ 7 = 1$

Since 3 generates all elements of the group $\mathbb{Z^*_7}$, 3 is a generator. Not every element will do this — for instance, 2 in the same group only generates some elements.

The concept of Generator allows us to visit every possible element in our group by simple multiplication. This brings us to one of the most important assumptions in cryptography: the discrete logarithm assumption.”

## Definition

Discrete Log Assumption: hard to know $x$ from $y$ when $y = g^x\ mod\ p$, where $g$ is a generator, and $p$ is large prime

## Intuition Behind Difficulty

Imagine standing in a circle with numbered positions (the group elements) and repeatedly stepping forward (exponentiation) from some starting point. If I tell you where I end up (the result of exponentiation), it’s very hard for you to figure out how many steps I took (the exponent).

While it’s easy to compute $g^x\ mod\ p$ (even for very large 𝑝), going in reverse — that is, finding 𝑥 given $g^x\ mod\ p$ — is much harder. In the next chapter, we will see that this assumption is a cornerstone of cryptography and underpins protocols like Diffie-Hellman and elliptic curve cryptography.”

## Reflection

That's a lot of concepts: Modulo, Modular Operation, Cyclic Group, Generator and Hardness assumption? How does each of these contribute to security of cryptographic system in general?

(Need to avoid run-on sentences aks just keep introducing concept without making students realize the implication... make students always ask why does this matter? --> some reflective questions along the way)
